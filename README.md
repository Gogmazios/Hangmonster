# Hangmonster
C# project from Spring 2015 semester.
A variation on hangman. The player is asked to choose a word from a pre-established list and is then pitted against a randomly-chosen monster from Greek mythology. The player is allowed to lie, resulting in different responses depending on her opponent. Developed entirely in Visual Studio.
